Catherine by Shel Silverstein

Catherine loves me,
Catherine cares,
Catherine picks me peaches and pears.
Catherine offers me candy and Cokes,
Catherine listens and laughs at my jokes.
Catherine helps when I get in a fight,
Catherine does all my homework at night.
Catherine misses me,
Catherine cries,
Catherine thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Catherine is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Catherine just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Catherine's hand,
In the darkness where Catherine usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Catherine's gone!
