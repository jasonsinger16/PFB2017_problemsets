# Write a python program 'kmer_counter.py' that takes command-line parameters:
#   kmer_length
#   filename.fastq
#   num_top_kmers

# The program should do the following:
#   read in the fastq file 'filename.fastq'
#   count kmers of size 'kmer_length'
#   output a table of the 'num_top_kmers' kmers sorted by abundance, descendingly.
